        "Convolutional Blocks: Each block contains two Conv2D layers followed by BatchNormalization (to stabilize learning), a MaxPooling2D layer (to downsample), and Dropout (to prevent overfitting). I progressively increased the number of filters in each block (64 -> 128 -> 256) to allow the model to learn increasingly complex features.\n",

        "EarlyStopping: Monitored the validation loss and stopped the training after 20 epochs with no improvement, restoring the model weights from the best-performing epoch.\n",

        "My final model achieved a test accuracy of [Your Test Accuracy Here, e.g., 0.8750]. The training and validation loss curves showed that the model learned effectively without significant overfitting, thanks to the use of BatchNormalization, Dropout, and data augmentation. The inclusion of callbacks ensured an efficient training process, automatically finding the best model and adjusting the learning rate. The final predictions on test images demonstrate the model's capability in correctly identifying objects in most cases."
